            <a href="https://biology.columbia.edu/programs/phd" target="_blank"><strong>Biological Science Phd Program</strong></a>
            <p>The research interests of the Department span a number of fields that are central to modern biology: cell & molecular, computational, developmental, structural biology & molecular biophysics, genetics & genomics, evolutionary biology, chemical biology, microbiology and neurobiology. As a student here you will have the opportunity to receive broadly based training in these areas and to develop research expertise through laboratory rotations and your thesis research. The intimate scale of the Department assures you of close contacts with the faculty and your fellow students while the location of the Department within the wide research community of New York City ensures the maximum possible exposure to exciting scientific developments. We have a steady flow of visitors from the US and abroad who enrich our offerings through seminars, discussions and informal meetings with research groups and faculty.</p>
            <p>
              The Department occupies a modern research facility on the Morningside Heights Campus of Columbia University, a comfortable University neighborhood. The equipment available to you is state of the art, ranging from oligonucleotide synthesizers to electron microscopes. Core facilities for protein biochemistry, cell sorting, transgenic mice and X-ray crystallography are available. A well equipped computer facility is located within the Fairchild Building adjacent to the research laboratories. The new Science and Engineering Library the home to the Digital Science Center is located nearby in the new Northwest Corner Building.
            </p>

            <a href="https://chem.columbia.edu/academics/graduate/interdisciplinary-biosciences-program/" target="_blank"><strong>Interdisciplinary Biosciences Program</strong></a>
            <p>The Interdisciplinary Biosciences Program brings together faculty and students working across traditional research disciplines to gain a quantitative and molecular understanding of biological systems. Monthly research seminars promote collaboration and provide feedback from colleagues with complementary expertise. The program provides a forum for coordinating and strengthening core equipment facilities to bring the latest technical advances to bear on this research. This group is working together to develop integrated curricula to train students working between biology and the physical sciences, computation, and engineering.</p>
            <p>
              The Interdisciplinary Biosciences Program brings together a dynamic group of interdisciplinary faculty from both the Morningside and Health Sciences Campuses. Participating faculty represent the Departments of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics,  Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Biological Sciences, Biomedical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, Physics, Mechanical Engineering, Medicine, Microbiology, Ophthalmology, Pharmacology and Physiology and Cellular Biophysics.

            <a href="https://columbiacmpb.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Cellular and Molecular Physiology & Biophysics Phd Program </strong></a>
            <p>The aim of the doctoral program in Cellular and Molecular Physiology & Biophysics is to provide a stimulating and supportive environment enabling graduate students to acquire fundamental training in physiology, cellular and molecular biology, and biophysics while participating in the rich intellectual life of Columbia University. The curriculum is designed to equip all students with scientific knowledge and professional skills required to complete their PhD research and to progress towards their independent research careers in academia or industry.</p>

            <p>
              Matriculating graduate students in our program may perform their dissertation research under the guidance of any approved dissertation sponsor in the Columbia University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Faculty are located on three campuses (Morningside Heights, Manhattanville, and Washington Heights). Lectures and course work are performed at CUIMC.

              Matriculating graduate students in our program may perform their dissertation research under the guidance of any approved dissertation sponsor in the Columbia University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Faculty are located on three campuses (Morningside Heights, Manhattanville, and Washington Heights). Lectures and course work are performed predominantly at CUIMC. Students will be expected to present their work at regular data clubs hosted by the students themselves, and at the annual departmental retreat in which students and faculty gather to discuss and celebrate exciting science.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to the curriculum, students will benefit from attending a regular and vibrant departmental weekly seminar series. Here, they will have ample opportunities to interact with speakers, and will also participate in the selection of outstanding scientists to invite. They will also have unrestricted access to all seminar series across the University.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              The program in Cellular and Molecular Physiology & Biophysics is co-directed by Jane Dodd (Professor of Physiology & Cellular Biophysics and of Neuroscience) and Filippo Mancia (Associate Professor of Physiology & Cellular Biophysics) and is hosted within the Department of Physiology & Cellular Biophysics, and supported primarily by NIH training grants, individual research laboratories and institutional commitment.
